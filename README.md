# Graphical Password Authentication System

A team of four has developed this Graphical Password Authentication System.

- It is an authentication system that uses some combination of graphical images replacing the regular passwords. Graphical passwords may offer better security than text-based passwords because most of the people use regular, popular passwords everywhere and are prone to social engineering attacks. So graphical passwords can put stop to many attacks of this kind.
